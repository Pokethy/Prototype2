# Prototype2

In this project, your objective will be throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you. In this unit I became more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation and I learnt how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.
